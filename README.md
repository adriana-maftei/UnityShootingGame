Main features I learned and build while developing this project:
- working with Physics (rigidbody, velocity, gravity), collisions, raycasts, 3d movement & rotation (Quaternion and Euler)
- adding animations and sounds using scripts
- creating alive caracters that deal damage and use health
- using Artificial Intelligence and Navigation Mesh for path detection for enemies
- integrating UI in the game
- creating menus, loading screens and transitions between scenes
- creating a first person camera
- creating customizable weapons settings in Unity inspector tab 
- instantiating objects and particles in the scene etc.
